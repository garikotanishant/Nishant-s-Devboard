## 10/21/2025 - Simulating movement  

This week, I started working on the software side of my AI robot dog project. I wrote and tested some basic Python code to simulate how the robot will respond to different commands. I also researched how to connect a Raspberry Pi and Arduino together for future hardware control. The goal was to start setting up the logic that will later control the motors and sensors once I get all the parts.
